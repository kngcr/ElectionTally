/*
I. Winner of the election

Write a C++ program that allows the user to enter the last names of five candidates
in a local election and the number of votes received by each candidate.
The program should then output each candidateâ€™s name, the number of votes received,
and the percentage of the total votes received by the candidate. Your program should also output the winner of the election.

Example:
enter candidates last name, there are five candidates
enter candidate 0 last name
Peter
enter no of votes received by candidate 0
30
enter candidate 1 last name
Roy
enter no of votes received by candidate 1
20
enter candidate 2 last name
Ali
enter no of votes received by candidate 2
40
enter candidate 3 last name
Hales
enter no of votes received by candidate 3
60
enter candidate 4 last name
John
enter no of votes received by candidate 4
10
result of the election.............
name of candidate       vote received   percentage
Peter                   30              18%
Roy                     20              12%
Ali                     40              25%
Hales                   60              37%
John                    10              6%
The winner is Hales


Note:
- Program must be written in C++ and must use a class
- Use \t when displaying candidate name, vote received and percentage
